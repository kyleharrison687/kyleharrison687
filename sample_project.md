# Massachusetts School Board Project

---

### WHY 

I was tasked with analyzing this data set as part of the DAA. The goal of the project is to create a dashboard that the Massachusetts School Board can use to make informed decisions about the state of their school system.

### What you will learn

<ul>
<li>The Massachusetts School System has 1800 Schools</li>
<li>Boston Prep. has 93% college attendance from it's graduates</li>
<li>Springfield Public Day High School has the lowest graduation rate at 8.7%</li>
<li>The Hawlemont District has the lowest 4th grade Math Proficiency average at 17%</li>
</ul>

### The Data

>This Data was provided to me by the DAA, but you can find the unedited data set [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ndalziel/massachusetts-public-schools-data)

  One of the first things that I decided to look into was to see how many total schools there were in the system, as you can see from the dashboard that there **1800** schools in the system. This is about 1 school for every four square miles of the state. This means that with a total student population of **954,369** each school has an average population of **530** students. 

  **Boston Preparatory Charter Public School** is the top performing school in the system when it comes to college attendance rates and boast a average post graduate college attendance rate of **93%** . The most interesting fact about this graduation rate is that they also have the largest class sizes in the state at **34** students per class on average.

  On the other end of the spectrum as far as performance goes the **Springfield Public Day High School** is struggling the most in the system in regards to graduation rate. **SPDH** had an abysmal graduation rate of **8.7%** and while there are other schools that are struggling similarly like **Boston Day and Evening Academy(9.8%)**, **Springfield High School(11.6%)**, and **Chicopee Academy(15.8%)** the system as a whole has more schools graduating above **50%** than it does below.

 I also analyzed some of the data from elementary age students to see how each district was performing on their fourth grade math proficiency. **The Hawlemont District** while not the only struggling school posted a terrible average of **17%**. Much like the high school graduation rates though majority of districts in the state are performing above **50%** and **The Hingham District** had the highest average math proficiency in the state at **91%**.

 ### Conclusions

 Overall, I think that the Massachusetts schools system is performing well. Majority of the schools in the state appear to be performing above the median on most metrics. My recommendation to the school board would be to focus on what is working in the majority of schools and try to see where the struggling schools are lacking in those categories. I would also suggest taking an in depth look at the bottom performing districts to focus on improvement right away.
